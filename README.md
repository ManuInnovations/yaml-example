##Bitbucket##
Hosting Multiple Projects Under a Single Website
You may have multiple projects that you want to host from the same Bitbucket websites, you can do this by placing each project in a repository subdirectory. In this example, you would want to organize things such that you can point users to:

https://accountname.bitbucket.io/subdir1forproject1
https://accountname.bitbucket.io/subdir2forproject2
https://accountname.bitbucket.io/subdir3forproject3
Each project sub-directory would act as a self-contained website with its own index.html.
